# AMKAT Simulation Study

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This R project was used to generate the data and associated plots and tables found in:

Brian Neal and Tao He. "An Adaptive Multivariate Kernel-Based Test for Association with Multiple Quantitative Traits in High-Dimensional Data." Genetic Epidemiology (Not yet submitted).

Executing the simulations requires having the AMKAT package installed, which can be found at github.com/brianpatrickneal/AMKAT


## Instructions

#### Executing the script 'AMKAT_simulation_study.R' in the main directory will generate all data and plots:
* Data will be contained in the subdirectory 'simulated_data'
* Plots will be contained in the subdirectory 'plots'

#### To generate a .tex file containing tables for size and power after the corresponding data has been generated, knit the file 'create_latex_tables.Rnw', located in the 'tables' subdirectory, making sure to knit using knitr instad of Sweave. The .tex file will be titled 'create_latex_tables.tex' and will be located in the 'tables' subdirectory. The LaTeX code contained in the file can be copied and inserted into another LaTeX document as desired.
