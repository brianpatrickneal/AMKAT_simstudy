# AMKAT Simulation Study

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is the R project used to house the source code, simulated data and full analysis of results for the simulation study found in:

Brian Neal and Tao He. "An Adaptive Multivariate Kernel-Based Test for Association with Multiple Quantitative Traits in High-Dimensional Data." In progress.


## Simulation Design

A complete description of the simulation study design can be found in our manuscript. Below are documents related to the implementation of our study design in R.
