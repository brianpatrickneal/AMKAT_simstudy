# AMKAT Simulation Study

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is the R project used to house the source code, simulated data and
full analysis of results for the simulation study found in:

Brian Neal and Tao He. “An Adaptive Multivariate Kernel-Based Test for
Association with Multiple Quantitative Traits in High-Dimensional Data.”
Genetic Epidemiology (Not yet submitted).

## State of Progress

This R project is currently in progress and is not yet fully complete:
\* Source code and simulated results are largely in a completed state.
\* Markdown documents for analysis of results are mostly in skeletal
form with analysis and commentary to be added.

## Simulation Design

### Initialization Script for Simulation Scenarios

### Correlation Heatmaps for Simulated SNP Set and its Signal Subsets

## Analysis of Results

### Size

### Proposed P-value Estimator

### Power

### Kernel Selection (Across Data Replicates)

### PhiMr Filter for Feature Selection (Across Data Replicates)

### Runtime Benchmarking
